  ## Citations
  Special thanks to Lindsey Graham for providing advice on setting up active / completed
  items list as well as how to clean the input.

  Reason: I was confused on how to implement a list for the completed items. Initially a checkbox
  form was considered just like how I created a to-do list in JavaScript. The lack of form submission
  on change however caused this implementation to be clunky user-wise. I reached out to Lindsey for
  help.
